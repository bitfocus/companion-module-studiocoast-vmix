# Patch Notes

**v4.0.0**
- Changes to Variable generation based on config options allowing granular control over what variables are generated, resulting in significant performance benefits by only generating the variables a user plans to use
- Added Variable list doc [docs/variables.md](./docs/variables.md)
- Added `preset` variable for the currently loaded preset
- Added `input_X_full_title`, `mix_X_preview_full_title`, `mix_X_program_full_title`, `dynamic_input_X_full_title` variables, which for inputs such as Lists contain the short title and the name of the current item
- Added `input_X_selectedindex` variable for Photo, VideoList, and VirtualSet, input types
- `input_X_remaining_mm:ss` renamed to `input_X_remaining_mm.ss`

- Fixed missing Stream 4 and 5 options in actions/feedbacks
- Added Local Variable support (such as $(this:page), $(this:row), etc...) to Actions that support parsing variables
- Better support for Sequential Action Group (keep in mind vMix only acknowledges receieving a command, not that the command execution is complete, so some use of Wait actions may still be required in an Action Group sequence)
