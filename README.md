# API Poll Interval
The majority of vMix data used by Companion for feedback and variables is retrieved through the vMix REST API, the frequency at which this data is polled can be changed in the instance config. All instances prior to 1.2.6 had a poll interval of 100ms, but from 1.2.6 the default has been changed to 250ms. It is recommended that users who need responsive feedbacks and had no previous issues to lower the interval in the config back to 100ms, and for users with a significantly large number of inputs or running on older hardware to either leave the interval at 250ms, or enter a slower interval should the server be insufficient for the number of inputs.


# Using Custom Commands/shortcuts
When using vMix shortcuts, please follow this syntax/layout, with space before the first value:

"ReplayMarkInOut Value=5000"

and if there is more than one parameter use "&" as a separator between them like the example below:

"SetOutput2 Value=Input&Input=3"


# Button Shifting
The ability to modify the action and feedback options by using the Toggle Shift action, which will split text inputs by the configured Shift Delimiter and determine which value to use based on the state of the Shift Action.

For some feedback, such as Tally and Layer Routing it's possible to enable 'blinking' which causes the feedback to indicate a solid color if the current Shift layer is active, or flash that color if it's an one of the inactive Shift layers that is showing feedback. For example, if you have a feedback to show the preview with the input set to "Cam1/Cam2", when shift is not toggled it would show a solid green when "Cam1" is in preview, or flash if "cam2" is in preview, and when Shift is toggled on the reverse would happen.


# HTTP API
This module now supports Companions HTTP API, providing endpoints that can be used by 3rd party applications, and as a Data Source in vMix itself. Information on the API endpoints is available in [docs/http_api.md](./docs/http_api.md)


# Recent Patches
**v4.0.0**
- Changes to Variable generation based on config options allowing granular control over what variables are generated, resulting in significant performance benefits by only generating the variables a user plans to use
- Added Variable list doc [docs/variables.md](./docs/variables.md)
- Added `preset` variable for the currently loaded preset
- Added `input_X_full_title`, `mix_X_preview_full_title`, `mix_X_program_full_title`, `dynamic_input_X_full_title` variables, which for inputs such as Lists contain the short title and the name of the current item
- Added `input_X_selectedindex` variable for Photo, VideoList, and VirtualSet, input types
- `input_X_remaining_mm:ss` renamed to `input_X_remaining_mm.ss`
- `input_X_remaining_mm:ss.ms` renamed to `input_X_remaining_mm.ss.ms`
- Fixed missing Stream 4 and 5 options in actions/feedbacks
- Added Local Variable support (such as $(this:page), $(this:row), etc...) to Actions that support parsing variables
- Better support for Sequential Action Group (keep in mind vMix only acknowledges receieving a command, not that the command execution is complete, so some use of Wait actions may still be required in an Action Group sequence)

**v3.9.6**
- Fixed an issue with the upgrade script migrating existing `Overlay - Functions` actions to support the new parameters in vMix 28

**v3.9.5**
- Fixed issue with mix preview/program variables not migrating to latest version
- Fixed issue relating to some audio Actions and Feedbacks set to the `selected` bus

**v3.9.4**
- Fixed issue with selected mix variable

**v3.9.3**
- Fixed issue with mix preview/program variables

**v3.9.2**
- Fixed missing MultiView2 and Mix options from `Output - Set Output Source` action

**v3.9.1**
- Fixed missing `General - Output Status` and  `General - Output NDI/SRT Status` feedbacks

**v3.9.0**
- Added Mix support for `Transition - Auto/Stinger Transition` action when using a Stinger transition
- Added `Transition - Transition Effect / Duration` Feedback to check what effect (and optionally duration) is set to Transitions 1 to 4
- Added `transition_X_effect` and `transition_X_duration` variables (X = 1 to 4)
