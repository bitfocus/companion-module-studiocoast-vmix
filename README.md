**API Poll Interval**

The majority of vMix data used by Companion for feedback and variables is retrieved through the vMix REST API, the frequency at which this data is polled can be changed in the instance config. All instances prior to 1.2.6 had a poll interval of 100ms, but from 1.2.6 the default has been changed to 250ms. It is recommended that users who need responsive feedbacks and had no previous issues to lower the interval in the config back to 100ms, and for users with a significantly large number of inputs or running on older hardware to either leave the interval at 250ms, or enter a slower interval should the server be insufficient for the number of inputs.

**Using Custom Commands/Shortcodes**

When usin vMix shortcodes, please follow this syntax/layout, with space before the first value:

"ReplayMarkInOut Value=5000"

and if there is more than one parameter use "&" as a separator between them like the example below:

"SetOutput2 Value=Input&Input=3"
